/**
 * webpack.development.js
 * 
 * What it Does:
 *   Webpack bundles up your application for the browser.
 *   This file tells webpack what to do when you want
 *   a development server to be created. This file sets up automatic reload
 *   as well as putting the configuration options into process.env to be
 *   picked up by the react app.
 * 
 * Things to Edit:
 *   Be careful when editing webpack configuration as it gets confusing
 *   quickly. If you want to make any changes to how your app is being
 *   rendered in development then this is the place to look. Things like
 *   transpiling a new file type or adding a webpack plugin can be done
 *   here.
